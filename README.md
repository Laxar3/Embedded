# Software timer for general embedded systems

Software timer abstraction for general embedded systems.

### ToDo list

* Phase 1

- [] Do deep copy instead of shallow copy of soft_timer_t;
- [] Take out the double pointer from soft_timer_create and soft_timer_destroy (personal note: needing in passing a number argument);
- [] Update _st_QUEUE_parserAndSet;
- [] Do tests in embedded systems and test in TM4C123;
- [] Make it 'repeatable';
- [] Rename the functions for better understanding.

* Phase 2

- [] Review the writting/code starndards;
- [] Make a simple tutorial on README;
- [] Do a wiki explaining the functioning of this code.
